# TheVillage

A new implementation of village game on Telegram (@villagegamebot)

## What is The Village / What will it be
We are a group of hobby developers and now we want to create a new Telegram Bot called The Village. The Village will be a text based "Farming" game, where users have there own Village and where they can harvest items and level up. If a user reaches a higher level he unlocks new items and if the level is high enougth he can update the village to a town. The user can go throught all ages of Human development beginning with just a simple farm, and later a kingdom or a castle followed by modern towns and in the end maybe the user can update his village to a spacestation like Babylon 5 or Deep Space Nine.

## Contribution
We are happy about everyone that joins the team and has fun on programming. We have a [Telegram-Group](https://t.me/TheVillageDev), where we discuss new features.
